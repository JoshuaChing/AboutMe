	<p>
		&nbsp; Born in Toronto, I spent majority of my time growing up in Markham. Graduated from Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School,
		I am currently studying in the Systems Design Engineering co-op program at the University of Waterloo.
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp; My journey as a programmer began in grade 9 where I was first exposed to the idea of coding. This grew into a passion
		to apply my thought process as an engineer to the complexity of programming. I aspire to design and develop applications that
		will solve every day challenges and make living simple.
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp; Asides from engineering, I also enjoy playing a variety of instruments including the guitar, drums, and ukulele. In high
		school I breakdanced and was a co-founder of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Dance Team. I also had the joy being on the high school
		Ultimate Frisbee Team.
		<br> <br>
		I would love to try new things and work with others who share the same passions as me. If you would like to contact me, feel free to
		e-mail me at <b>jyching@uwaterloo.ca<b>
